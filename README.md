Creating an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building a simple yet functional timepiece that visually represents the current time. The HTML provides the basic structure, including the clock face and hands. CSS is used for styling, ensuring the clock looks polished and visually appealing. JavaScript drives the functionality, calculating the positions of the hour, minute, and second hands based on the current time, and updating these positions in real-time. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, CSS animations, and time-based updates, making it an excellent learning experience for beginners.# Analog-Clock
